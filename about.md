*HITMC Project* is a group of people who loves open-source and Minecraft.
It originates from *OneSMP (一个纯净生存服)* in *Harbin Institute of Technology*.
However, we welcome everyone who loves Minecraft and contributes to open-source Minecraft-related code.


# How to join HITMC

Though *HITMC Project* originates from *OneSMP* in 2020, it's not an organization owned by *OneSMP* nowadays, but a group of Minecraft lovers (mostly) in HIT.
If you wish to hack with HITMC and do open-source stuff for Minecraft, then you may start from:

1. Start using projects created by HITMC.
2. Submit issues for existing repo in HITMC, describing what problem you've encountered or what should be improved.
3. Submit pull requests for existing repo in HITMC, and accept the inspection from the repo's owner.
4. Create a original or forked repo in HITMC, and keep improving it.


# How we manage ourselves

In HITMC, there are owners and members. Owners are those people who own at least one repo belong to HITMC.

When we talk about a person has *owned* a repo, we mean:

- This repo is originally created by himself or forked by himself.
- He keeps track of issues and PRs of the repo he owned:
  + He reviews code contributions from other people, and decide how to merge it into the mainstream.
  + He manages issues created by others, and decide how to handle them.

Especially, the repository `hit-mc.github.io` is owned by all members in our organization. No one can directly push to its main branch. All pull requests should be reviewed and accepted by everyone.
